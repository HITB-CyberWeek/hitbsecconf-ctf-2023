# <img src="static/hitb-logo.png" width="30" height="35"> HITB SECCONF CTF 2023

HITB SECCONF CTF is an onsite + online international challenge in information security. Developed by Hackerdom team for HITB SECCONF in Phuket, Thailand. HITB SECCONF CTF 2023 was held on August 24thâ€“25th, 2023.

The contest is driven by almost classic rules for Attack-Defense [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_%28cybersecurity%29). Each team is given a set of vulnerable services.
Organizers regularly fill services with private information â€” the flags.
The goal of each team is to find vulnerabilities, fix them in their services and exploit them to get flags from other teams.

You can read the details on the official contest website: https://ctf.hackerdom.ru/hitb-ctf-phuket-2023/.
